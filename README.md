# ucbproject1
Repository for first project that is a requirement for completion of the data analytics bootcamp. Feb 2019 cohort.

The project looks at police incident reports for the city of San Francisco and provides a trend analysis for the number of car break-ins before and after reclassification of the incident from a felony to a misdemeanour. The analysis also looks at the trend in different neighborhoods as well as different cities.
